### The Challenge:

This is a .NET 9 Blazor Web App with global server interactivity.

Our customer has requested we allow currency (decimal) values to be formatted with a $, and made editable.

We can not use a third-party tool. We must use a standard HTML input tag.

How can we allow editing and still format the value as currency rounded to two decimal places and including a dollar sign?

Non-numeric values should be ignored, as should numbers two places to the right of the decimal point.
